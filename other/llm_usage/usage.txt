When setting prior assumptions for a Bayesian model, especially using stan_glm(), it's important to strike a balance between being informative (if you have strong prior knowledge) and being non-informative (if you don’t want the priors to heavily influence the posterior). Let's review the priors you’ve defined and consider if any adjustments are needed.

Here’s the setup you’ve mentioned:

r
复制代码
log_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = log(income) ~ Sex + educ + married + lf + num_work + num_occu,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)
Breakdown of Prior Assumptions:
Prior for Coefficients (prior):

r
复制代码
prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
Interpretation: You are assigning a normal distribution centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 2.5 to the regression coefficients. This prior implies that you believe the coefficients will most likely be close to zero, but with enough flexibility to allow for moderate effects.
Reasonability:
Informative or Non-informative? This is a weakly informative prior. A standard deviation of 2.5 is not overly restrictive, but it will still discourage excessively large coefficients, especially if there is no strong prior knowledge about the effect sizes.
This setup is reasonable if you have no strong prior belief about the magnitude of the coefficients, or if you're trying to avoid excessive influence from prior assumptions.
If you do have knowledge suggesting certain variables should have a stronger effect (e.g., education or labor force participation), you might want to use a smaller scale (e.g., scale = 1 or scale = 0.5), which would indicate a stronger belief that the effects will be close to zero.
Prior for the Intercept (prior_intercept):

r
复制代码
prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
Interpretation: Like the coefficients, the intercept also has a normal prior centered at zero with a standard deviation of 2.5.
Reasonability:
For the intercept, this prior might be reasonable if

Thank you for providing the detailed prior assumptions. Let's review each prior individually and see if adjustments might be necessary based on your goals and the characteristics of your data.

1. Prior for the Coefficients (prior):
r
复制代码
prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
Interpretation: You're using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2.5 for the regression coefficients. This prior suggests that you expect the coefficients to be centered around zero, but you allow for moderate variability in the magnitude of these coefficients.
Reasonability:
This is a weakly informative prior. The scale of 2.5 allows the coefficients to vary widely but still discourages extreme values. It’s a good choice if you have little prior knowledge about the relationships between the predictors and the outcome.
If you believe some predictors (e.g., education, labor force) have stronger effects on income, you might want to tighten the prior (e.g., reduce the scale to 1 or 0.5) to indicate stronger beliefs about these relationships.
Conclusion: This prior is reasonable if you're unsure about the magnitude of the coefficients, but consider tightening it if you expect more substantial effects from certain predictors.
2. Prior for the Intercept (prior_intercept):
r
复制代码
prior_intercept = normal(location = 500, scale = 100, autoscale = TRUE)
Interpretation: You're assigning a normal distribution for the intercept with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This suggests that you expect the intercept (which represents the log-income when all predictors are zero) to be around 500, with some variability.
Reasonability:
If the log-transformed income is expected to have a mean around 500 for the baseline category (with all predictors being zero), then this prior could be reasonable. However, you should check if this expectation aligns with the actual data.
Concerns:
Location: If the log-income variable is on a much different scale, say in the range of tens or hundreds, a location of 500 for the intercept might be too high. You might want to reconsider this location depending on the typical range of log(income) in your data.
Scale: The scale of 100 might be too large. If you believe that the intercept should be relatively precise, you might want to reduce the scale (e.g., to 10 or 20) to reflect more confidence in the expected value of the intercept.
Conclusion: This prior seems reasonable if 500 is a good guess for the intercept, but be cautious if the range of your data differs significantly. You may want to adjust the location and scale based on your data's characteristics.
3. Prior for the Error Variance (prior_aux):
r
复制代码
prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE)
Interpretation: You're assigning an exponential prior to the auxiliary parameter (which models the error variance, often denoted as sigma in regression). The rate of 1 means that you're assuming the variance is likely to be small, but it can still vary to a moderate degree.
Reasonability:
The exponential distribution is commonly used for variance parameters and represents a non-informative prior in the sense that it allows for a wide range of possible values. A rate of 1 is not too restrictive and suggests that large variances are not extremely unlikely, but they are somewhat discouraged.
Alternatives: If you expect the residuals to have a larger variance, you might consider increasing the rate parameter (e.g., rate = 0.5) to allow for larger variances. If you have reason to believe the variance is small, you could tighten the prior (e.g., rate = 2 or 3).
Conclusion: This prior is reasonable if you don't have strong beliefs about the error variance, but you might adjust it depending on how spread out your data is or if you have any prior knowledge about the expected variability.
General Recommendations:
Check the scale and range of your variables: Ensure that your priors, especially the intercept prior (prior_intercept), are consistent with the actual data scale. For example, if your log(income) variable ranges from 10 to 200, a prior mean of 500 for the intercept might be too large.

Adjust the intercept prior: If you are uncertain about the intercept, consider using a more data-driven approach, such as looking at the median or mean of the log(income) for a baseline category (e.g., Sex = female, educ = 0), and setting the prior location accordingly.

Prior for coefficients: The prior you've set for the coefficients is relatively weak, which is useful if you have no strong prior information about their effect sizes. If you want to tighten your assumptions, consider using a smaller scale (e.g., scale = 1).

Examine model fit: After running the model, inspect the diagnostics (e.g., Rhat, n_eff, posterior distributions) to ensure that the model has converged properly and the priors are not overly influential or causing instability.

In Summary:
Your prior setup looks reasonable if you don’t have strong prior knowledge of the coefficients or error variance. However, you may want to adjust the intercept prior (prior_intercept) if it doesn’t align with your data's scale. The other priors seem appropriate, but feel free to adjust the rate of the exponential prior for the variance based on the expected spread of your data.

Given that you have prior knowledge that higher education is associated with higher income, you can adjust your priors to reflect this belief. Specifically, you'll want to tighten the prior on the coefficient for education (educ) to reflect a stronger expectation that the effect will be positive. Here's how you can adjust the priors:

1. Tightening the Prior for Education (educ):
If you expect a positive relationship between education and income, you can use a smaller standard deviation for the prior on educ to express more confidence in the effect being positive and not too large or small.

Current setup:

r
复制代码
prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
Adjustment: For educ, tighten the prior to reflect a stronger positive effect:

r
复制代码
prior_educ = normal(location = 0.2, scale = 0.1)
Interpretation: A location of 0.2 suggests that you expect a positive effect of education on income, with a tighter range around 0.2 (with a smaller scale of 0.1 to reduce uncertainty).
This would express that you expect education to have a positive effect, but you're limiting the variability to keep the prior relatively focused on a reasonable range.
2. Priors for Other Coefficients:
For other predictors like Sex, married, lf, num_work, and num_occu, you could leave the priors as they are if you don't have strong beliefs about their effects, or you could tighten them similarly to educ if you have prior knowledge about the expected direction or magnitude.
For example, if you expect num_work (number of work hours) to have a positive effect on income, you could apply a similar adjustment to its prior:
r
复制代码
prior_num_work = normal(location = 0.5, scale = 0.2)
3. Prior for Intercept (prior_intercept):
If you expect the intercept (i.e., the baseline income) to be around a certain value, you can adjust the prior for the intercept. However, based on your prior knowledge, the most important adjustment will likely be for educ. The intercept prior is less critical unless you have specific knowledge about the baseline income.
4. Prior for Error Variance (prior_aux):
The error variance prior (prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE)) doesn't need to change based on your prior knowledge about education and income. However, if you expect the data to have less variability due to a more predictable relationship between education and income, you could tighten the error variance prior, though this is optional.
Example Revised Model:
Here’s how you could implement the adjustments:

r
复制代码
log_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = log(income) ~ Sex + educ + married + lf + num_work + num_occu,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),  # Prior for other predictors
  prior_educ = normal(location = 0.2, scale = 0.1),  # Adjusted prior for education
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 500, scale = 100, autoscale = TRUE),  # Prior for intercept (adjust as needed)
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),  # Prior for error variance
  seed = 853
)
Why These Adjustments?
By tightening the prior on education (educ), you're reflecting your prior belief that education has a stronger and positive impact on income, with less uncertainty in the coefficient for education.
For other predictors, if you don’t have strong beliefs, you can keep their priors wide and non-informative or make slight adjustments if you have other insights.

Your adjustments to the prior parameters for both models seem reasonable, but there are a few points to consider when fine-tuning your priors, especially in relation to the log transformation.

1. First Model (Without Log Transformation)
Formula: income ~ Sex + educ + married + lf + num_work + num_occu
Prior setup:
prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
prior_intercept = normal(location = 500, scale = 100, autoscale = TRUE)
prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE)
Comments:
Prior for coefficients: The prior normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE) is a reasonable non-informative prior for the other predictors, suggesting that you don't have strong prior beliefs about their relationships with income.
Intercept prior: The normal(location = 500, scale = 100) prior on the intercept is a reasonable choice unless you have more specific information about the baseline income (e.g., income when all predictors are zero). If you know that income is usually higher, you could shift the intercept location, but 500 is a reasonable starting point.
Error variance prior: The exponential(rate = 1) for the error variance (prior_aux) is a reasonable prior. It assumes that the error variance has a positive distribution, but you could tighten this prior if you expect lower variance (which would imply a more predictable relationship).
2. Second Model (With Log Transformation)
Formula: log(income) ~ Sex + educ + married + lf + num_work + num_occu
Prior setup:
prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
prior_intercept = normal(location = 10, scale = 5, autoscale = TRUE)
prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE)
Comments:
Prior for coefficients: The same prior (normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)) is used for the coefficients here, which is reasonable if you still don't have strong prior beliefs about the effect sizes. However, after taking the log of income, you might expect the relationships to be a bit more constrained (since log-transformed income would typically reduce the scale of variability), so you might consider slightly tightening the prior for educ or other predictors if you believe their impact should be more robust.

Intercept prior: The normal(location = 10, scale = 5) prior on the intercept for the log-transformed model is more appropriate than the one in the first model. Since the log of income is being modeled, the location of the intercept should reflect a more reasonable baseline value. You are modeling log(income), so a value near 10 makes sense as a starting point, depending on the distribution of income in your dataset. You might want to experiment with this if you think the baseline log-transformed income should be higher or lower.

Error variance prior: The exponential(rate = 1) prior for the error variance is appropriate and consistent across both models. Since the log transformation reduces variance (by stabilizing income growth), this prior may perform well in both models.

Additional Considerations:
Log-Transformed Data:

When you apply a log transformation, the coefficients are interpreted in terms of percentage change rather than absolute change. For instance, a coefficient for educ in the log-transformed model indicates the relative change in income for a unit change in education. The intercept prior should reflect this change as well. Your prior for the intercept (normal(location = 10, scale = 5)) seems reasonable given the log-transformation, but you can adjust it further if you have more domain knowledge about typical log-transformed income values.
Tuning Priors for Education:

If you have prior knowledge that education has a strong effect on income, you can tighten the prior for educ in the second model. For instance:
r
复制代码
prior_educ = normal(location = 0.2, scale = 0.1)
This would indicate a stronger belief in the positive effect of education on log-transformed income, with a smaller range of uncertainty.
Diagnostics:

Be sure to check the diagnostics (Rhat, n_eff, etc.) after fitting the models. If the models converge well and the effective sample size (n_eff) is sufficiently large, your priors and model choices are likely reasonable.
Model Comparison:

To compare the models (the log-transformed vs. non-log-transformed), consider looking at performance metrics like AIC/BIC, posterior predictive checks, and out-of-sample validation (e.g., using cross-validation).
Summary:
The prior adjustments you've made seem reasonable given the context and your log transformation.
You might consider tightening the priors for educ or other predictors if you have more domain knowledge about their expected effects.
Make sure to validate the model performance and convergence diagnostics to ensure these priors are fitting well to your data.
